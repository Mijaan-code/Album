    My eyes no dey close anymore <br>
Everyday I have been putting effort <br>
For this money (this money)<br>
I never really give up <br>
I no go really back down <br>
Can't you see.<br>

Chorus:<br>
Life is a mystery<br>

You don't know me <br>
If u get it I say u don't me<br>
You don't know me <br>
If u get it I say u don't me<br>
<br>           
Hook:<br>
Everyday we dey move <br>
We dey shoot on sight <br>
Nobody fit tell me what to do<br> 
Nobody fit tell me how to leave my life<br> 
I dey I dey try I dey try survive <br>
For this place I be super star <br>
Super star I have been shining like<br> 
A diamond, I have been shining like <br>
A diamond<br>
<br>      
Mijaan-Verse 2: <br>

Life is a mystery<br>              
 who can tell me how solve it <br>  
Calculator sef no fit withstand it<br>
Day and night all the time am thinking<br> 
Why some go rich and <br>
Others are suffering <br>
<br>
Hustling go make me mad<br>
Am high cause all I see <br>
Is a cash and a bullion van<br>
I dey loose my mind <br>
I no fit figure out what is good<br> 
From what is bad <br>

Who the hell can make me smile<br> 
Who the hell can solve my case and<br> 
Free my mind <br>
Who the hell is my sunshine <br>
Who the hell can tell that lie let<br> 
Me stand my ground <br>
<br>
Is it my mom<br> 
Is it my dad <br>
Is it my bro <br>
Is it my sis <br>
Is my guy Engy <br>
Wey sey life is nothing but a mystery<br> 
<br>
Chorus:<br>
Life is a mystery<br>

      <h3>Short-Dumb-Arrogant Lyrics </h3>
       <p>
        Mjay mask off record <br>
        <br>
Let me tell u a story <br>
About a girl  from port Harcourt<br> 
If call her she don't pick up <br>
If you text her no response<br>
That's how her life was <br>
<br>
Very arrogant girl <br>
Very stubborn <br>
She was very short<br> 
Without make up <br>
She was really used to<br> 
 insults<br>
And her boyfriend spends alot<br>
<br>
Give her ur heart<br> 
She will break it <br>
Give ur love <br>
She won't take it<br> 
Tell her ur mind <br>
She will play u<br>
Be very careful<br>
<br>
She was a gold digger<br> 
Without tools <br>
She can finish you like a fool<br>
Her head was shaped like a spoon <br>
And her mouth like a rule <br>
<br>
You cannot reason with her<br> 
Cause she is prideful <br>
You cannot give her advice<br> 
She will not regard u<br>
You cannot reach her standard<br> 
She was a disciple <br>
You cannot go out with her<br> 
She will disgrace u<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
Is her is her <br>
Short dumb arrogant<br>

        <br>
        Nowadays people are squeezing <br>
        Face <br>
        Suffering and smiling <br>
        It is all pretense<br>
        Hunger in the country <br>
        We don do protest <br>
        But still it's not making sense <br>
        <br>
        Am trying so hard to <br>
        escape this Mess <br>
        Should I live the country <br>
        Through desert plain<br>
        Should I take my life so that <br>
        I can rest <br>
        Or make I just face my fears<br>
        <br>
        Chorus:<br>
        Oh God deliver us<br>
        From this dark world<br>
        Make I no die for this tumoil<br>

        Is too much <br>
        <br>
        Oh God I no wan <br>

        No water to baff<br>
        <br>
        Verse 2 <br>
        What should I say to <br>
        The upcoming ones<br>
        What should I say to the generation<br>
        All the young ones who wants to <br>
        Give birth.<br>
        Ooh no oh no <br>
        Can you sacrifice for the ones <br>
        You love <br>
        Can you go a day without eating <br>
        Ones<br> 
        Can you work hard for the<br> 
        Little ones<br>
        <br>
        Chorus:<br>
        Oh God deliver us<br>
